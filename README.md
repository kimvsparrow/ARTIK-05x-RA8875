# TizenRT for ARTIK05x w/ RA8875

This project forks [TizenRT](https://github.com/SamsungARTIK/TizenRT) from [SamsungARTIK](https://github.com/SamsungARTIK), the ARTIK 05x-focused fork of [TizenRT 1.0](https://github.com/Samsung/TizenRT) from [SamsungOpenSource](https://github.com/Samsung).

TizenRT is a lightweight RTOS-based platform to support low-end IoT devices. It is largely based on [NuttX](https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/nuttx). TizenRT didn't bring all of the device drivers or any of the [NX](http://www.nuttx.org/doku.php?id=documentation:nxgraphics) graphics subsystem from NuttX. This project adds RA8875 support back into TizenRT over an SPI bus, and adds back the graphics subsystem.

(Maybe this is a bad idea, but early indications are that it might kinda work!)

## Display

I picked up an EastRising [ER-TFTM043-3](https://www.buydisplay.com/default/4-3-tft-lcd-display-module-controller-board-serial-spi-i2c-mcu) from BuyDisplay. It has a 4.3" display with options for things like bus interfaces and touch screens. Right now this project is targeted to the SPI 4-wire, 3.3V option. Touch is a future goal.

### Wiring

All wiring is between the Artik 053 dev kit CON703 and ER-TFTM043-3 display JP1/CON1 headers. I'm using male-female ribbon jumper cables [from Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LZF1ZSZ/) but of course use whatever you want.

| Signal | Artik name | Artik pin | Display pin | Display name |
| ------ | ---------- | --------- | ----------- | ------------ |
| 3.3V   | VCC_EXT3P3 | 2         | 3           | VDD
| 3.3V   | VCC_EXT3P3 | 14        | 4           | VDD
| GND    | GND        | 12        | 1           | GND
| GND    | GND        | 24        | 2           | GND
| MOSI   | XSPI0_CLK  | 16        | 8           | SCLK
| MOSI   | XSPI0_CS   | 18        | 5           | /SCS
| MISO   | XSPI0_MISO | 20        | 6           | SDO
| MOSI   | XSPI0_MOSI | 22        | 7           | SDI

### Driver

The ra8875_spi bridge between the RA8875 LCD and SPI drivers took a bit of experimentation to get right. Here are the main things that I needed to do that seem to contradict other sources (including the RA8875 datasheet):

* Configured SPI to Mode 0. Maybe I have a bizarro RA8875 chip, or they changed the behavior without changing the docs, or my bus timing is totally wack. Everything I've read says it's Mode 3.
* Disabled software reset of the at driver initialization time. I think I was able to recover normal functionality when poking registers manually, but when run by the driver routines the SPI interface would freeze every time.
* SYSR color depth setting (bits 3,2) needs to be set to b10 instead of b11. Setting to b11 seems to transfer only the low-order byte as an 8-bit color to the display.

There's a lot of insight into the chip at https://github.com/sumotoy/RA8875/wiki, with the above caveats. In particular, it validated my thought that the R1/R2/R3 pullups and C1/C2 caps are pretty useless and are possibly detrimental to high-speed SPI operation.

## Building

The `artik053/ra8875` configuration set is preconfigured for the ER-TFTM043-3 over SPI. I haven't written up a proper example program to run through the display routines, so there's not much to see at the moment.

* Change to <root>/os/tools
* Configure the build environment with `./configure.sh artik053/ra8875`
* Change to <root>/os
* Run `make menuconfig` and change options as required. The RA8875 bits are in Device Drivers -> LCD Driver Support.
* Build with `make`

Lots more hints:
* https://developer.artik.io/documentation/artik-05x/getting-started/ and
* https://github.com/kimvsparrow/ARTIK-05x-RA8875/blob/artik/build/configs/artik05x/README.md

If your goal is to build an SDK to export into the Artik IDE, that's a whole rigamarole that I'm probably not going to get into here.

Everything below here ought to be from the forked [TizenRT](https://github.com/SamsungARTIK/TizenRT) project.

## Overview

> * Homepage : https://www.artik.io/modules/artik-05x/

Wi-Fi®-based IoT module with built-in hardware security for single-function “things”.

ARTIK 05x series Smart IoT Modules bring Wi-Fi to things that need compactness and connectivity, but without sacrificing hardware-based security. ARTIK053s and ARTIK055s have built-in, enterprise-grade security for a strong root of trust with Samsung Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and mutual authentication to ARTIK cloud services.

Each Samsung ARTIK IoT module is a true System on Module (SoM), with CPUs, networking, wireless radios, and full system software stack, all build onto a single, easy-to-integrate package.

The ARTIK 05x family runs Tizen RT, a platform that includes a compact RTOS with built-in TCP/IP stack and support for Lightweight Machine-to-machine (LWM2M) protocol. This also means you can develop for ARTIK 05x using free tools like ARTIK IDE, GCC C/C++ compilers, and OpenOCD.

![ARTIK053 and ARTIK055s](./external/docs/media/artik053055.png)

#### Performance and flexibility

> * 32-bit ARM® Cortex® R4 @ 320MHz for applications
> * 29 dedicated GPIO ports, 2 SPI, 4 UART (2-pin), 4 ADC, 1 JTAG, 2 I2C
> * Input voltage: 3.3VDC (ARTIK055s), 5-12VDC (ARTIK053/053s)

#### Robust security (“s” versions)

> * Completely integrated security subsystem
> * Secure communication with unique, per-device key for authentication
> * Secure boot to make sure only authorized software can run
> * Secure storage protected by physically unclonable function (PUF)

#### Integrated and tested middleware

> * TizenRT with RTOS, Wi-Fi and networking middleware
> * API interface to simplify development process
> * LWM2M support for device management

#### Fully integrated with ARTIK IoT Platform and ARTIK cloud services

> * Mobile reference app to add modules to ARTIK cloud services easily
> * Manage devices, including OTA updates, with ARTIK cloud services

<!-- Setup Environment -->

## Ubuntu Development Setting

Install the most basic packages for using TizenRT.
```bash
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get upgrade
$ sudo apt-get install build-essential openocd git gcc-arm-none-eabi gdb-arm-none-eabi minicom
```

## Getting the toolchain

Get the build in binaries and libraries, [gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q3-20150921-linux.tar.bz2](https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded/4.9/4.9-2015-q3-update/+download/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q3-20150921-linux.tar.bz2)

Untar the archive file.
```bash
$ mv gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q3-20150921-linux.tar.bz2 /opt/.
$ cd /opt
$ tar -xvf gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q3-20150921-linux.tar.bz2
$ tee -a ~/.bashrc << __EOF__

# cross compiler
export CROSS_COMPILE="/opt/gcc-arm-none-eabi-4_9-2015q3/bin"
export PATH="${CROSS_COMPILE}:${PATH}"

__EOF__

```

and export the path like.
```bash
export PATH=<Your Toolchain PATH>:$PATH
```

## Set kconfig-frontends

This package is used by the TizenRT to configure the build. You can change build environment, what is enabled as peripherals from the SoC and from the board.
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install gperf libncurses5-dev flex bison
$ git clone https://bitbucket.org/nuttx/tools.git tools
$ cd tools/kconfig-frontends
$ ./configure --enable-mconf --disable-gconf --disable-qconf --prefix=/usr
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

## Getting the sources

The main branch is `artik`.
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/SamsungARTIK/TizenRT.git
$ cd TizenRT
```
Since then, `TizenRT` means the path where the source was cloned.

## On Chip Debugger installation

OpenOCD is used to program and debug.

OpenOCD v0.10.0 is recommended and can be installed like below, but pre-built OpenOCD binaray on `TizenRT/build/tools/openocd/linux64(or 32)` can be used without installing.
```bash
$ sudo apt-get build-dep openocd
$ git clone --depth 1 -b v0.10.0 https://git.code.sf.net/p/openocd/code openocd-code
$ cd openocd-code
$ ./bootstrap
$ ./configure
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

<!-- Development -->

## Directory Structure about Source Code

This project has the following directory structure.
```
    TizenRT
    ├── apps      : Application Directory
    ├── build     : Build Environment & Output
    ├── external  : External Application
    ├── framework : External APIs
    ├── lib       : Library (libc, libxx)
    ├── os        : Main Kernel & BSP(Build Support Package)
    └── tools     : Useful Tools
```

## Configuration Sets

To build a TizenRT application, use the default configuration files named `defconfig` under `TizenRT/build/configs/<board>/` folder.

After configuration, you can add/remove the configuration you want via menuconfig. If you want to run menuconfig, you need to install `kconfig-frontends`.
```bash
$ cd os
$ make menuconfig
```

#### nettest

This is the basic configuration of ARTIK05x products. You can set and build the following:
```bash
$ cd os
$ ./config.sh artik053/nettest
```

#### onboard

This is the configuration for the production phase of ARTIK05x product. When you download it to the board, the `artik_onboarding` app will start automatically when it boots.
```bash
$ cd os
$ ./config.sh artik053/onboard
```

#### other configures

The following environment settings are divided into three stages and used in advance. The details are as follows.

1) minimal
```bash
$ cd os
$ ./config.sh artik053/minimal
```
> * OS kernel
> * Customized C Library
> * Security(TLS)
> * BSP(boot loader)
> * Power
> * Networking support (LWIP, DHCP Client, Wi-Fi)

2) typical
```bash
$ cd os
$ ./config.sh artik053/typical
```
> * OS kernel

> * Network Utilities(FTP Client, Websock, Webclient, Webserver, NTP Client)

3) extra
```bash
$ cd os
$ ./config.sh artik053/extra
```
> * OS kernel
> * Customized C Library
> * Security(TLS)
> * BSP(boot loader)
> * Power
> * Networking support (LWIP, DHCP Client, DHCP Server, Wi-Fi)
> * Watchdog

> * Tash
> * I2S
> * DMA
> * System IO(I2C, UART, GPIO, PWM, SPI)
> * Network Utilities(FTP Client, Websock, Webclient, Webserver, NTP Client, CoAP, MQTT)

## How to Build

Configure the build from `TizenRT/os/tools` directory
```bash
$ cd os
$ ./config.sh <board>/<configuration_set>
```
For list of boards and configuration set supported, refer belows.

Above copies the canned configuration-set for the particular board, into the `TizenRT/os` directory.

Configuration can be modified through make menuconfig from `TizenRT/os`.
```bash
$ cd os
$ make menuconfig
```

Finally, initiate build by make from `TizenRT/os`.
```bash
$ cd os
$ make
```

Built binaries are in `TizenRT/build/output/bin`.
```bash
$ cd build/output/bin
$ ls
System.map  tinyara  tinyara.bin  tinyara_head.bin  tinyara.map  tinyara_memstats.txt
```

## How to program a binary

After building TizenRT, follow below steps at `TizenRT/os` folder.

This makes complete set of binaries programmed. `make download ALL`
```bash
$ cd os
$ make download ALL
```

If you want to download only the necessary binaries, use `make download <partition_name>` as follows.
```bash
$ cd os
$ make download os
```
```bash
$ cd os
$ make download bl2
```
You can refer to the [partition_map.cfg](../artik05x/scripts/partition_map.cfg) file for the partition name.

## How to clear flashed content on a board

You can also delete the binaries on the board. You can clean the board with the following command. `make download erase ALL`
```bash
$ cd os
$ make download erase ALL
```

You can also erase only specific areas. This is especially useful for refreshing the user area (smartfs area). `make download erase <partition_name>`
```bash
$ cd os
$ make download erase os
```
```bash
$ cd os
$ make download erase user
```

## How to use JTAG equiqments

![jtag pin kit](./external/docs/media/jtagkit.png)

If you are using the Starter Kit, you can use the JTAG pin(CON707).

![jtag pin module](./external/docs/media/jtagmodule.png)

If you are using only the ARTIK05x module, you can connect it using the JTAG pin output from the module.

## GPIO Mapping

The GPIO PAD name on the schematic differs from the GPIO name of the device. Please refer to the table below.

|    XGPIO0   |    XGPIO1   |    XGPIO2   |    XGPIO3   |    XGPIO4   |    XGPIO5   |    XGPIO6   |    XGPIO7   |
|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|

| /dev/gpio53 | /dev/gpio54 | /dev/gpio55 | /dev/gpio56 | /dev/gpio20 | /dev/gpio57 | /dev/gpio58 | /dev/gpio59 |

## SERIAL Mapping

![uart default console](./external/docs/media/uartconsole.png)

You need the following settings in menuconfig.
> * Device Drivers > Serial Driver Support > Serial console

The mapping for the UART changes depending on the selection of the **serial console**. The default setting for the serial console is `UART4`. At this time, the device is set as follows.

|   XUART4   |   XUART0   |   XUART1   |   XUART2   |   XUART3   |
|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| /dev/ttyS0 | /dev/ttyS1 | /dev/ttyS2 | /dev/ttyS3 | /dev/ttyS4 |

If you change the serial console to UART3, the mapping of the other device changes as follows.

|   XUART3   |   XUART0   |   XUART1   |   XUART2   |   XUART4   |
|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| /dev/ttyS0 | /dev/ttyS1 | /dev/ttyS2 | /dev/ttyS3 | /dev/ttyS4 |

## How to enable Secure shell

After booting TizenRT, you can put the TASH shell invisible to the user. We call this "Secure Shell". If you want to use this feature, do the following in menuconfig.
> * Application Configuration > Enable Shell > Enable Secure shell

You can specify the password that the user must enter. Use `sha256sum` command to extract sha value as follows.
```bash
$ echo -n TizenRT | sha256sum
436890f31fcd6b154a0e49df9f190bd8b1dcd4b917a7a80b2d928452c22901f7
```

Enter the sha value extracted above from menuconfig.
> * Application Configuration > Enable Shell > SHA256 encrypted password

When you boot TizenRT, you must enter `TizenRT` to see the TASH shell.
```
PASSWORD>>*******              // TizenRT
TASH>>
```

## How to save/restore wifi info

![wifi info](./external/docs/media/wifiinfo.jpg)

Only in case that file system is available, it stores information as file `/mnt/wifi/slsiwifi.conf`. You need the following settings in menuconfig.
> * Application Configuration > Network Utilities > SLSI Wi-Fi API > Enable "Support filesystem"

```
TASH>> wifi startsta
TASH>> wifi join <ssid> <key> <security>
TASH>>
TASH>> wifi saveconfig                        # save wifi information
TASH>> cat /mnt/wifi/slsiwifi.conf            # check wifi information
TASH>>
TASH>> reboot
TASH>>
TASH>> wifi startsta                          # restore wifi connect
TASH>>
```

## How to enable the ARTIK SDK

![ARTIK SDK](./external/docs/media/artiksdk.png)

If you want to use the `ARTIK SDK`, you need the following settings in menuconfig.
> * External Functions > Enable "ARTIK SDK"
> * Save and exit
> * Launch the build

If you enable ARTIK SDK and then build it, it will automatically download the ARTIK SDK sources from github and build it. You do not need to download additional files.

In addition, to enable the `ARTIK SDK examples`, set the following in menuconfig:
> * Application Configuration > Examples > Enable "ARTIK SDK examples"
> * Press Enter then select all the examples you want to include in the image

## How to test OCF certification

![OCF Certified](./external/docs/media/ocfcertified.png)

Samsung ARTIK05x becomes the first family of IoT systems-on-module to be certified under Open Connectivity Foundation 1.3 standards. If you want to test OCF certification, you need the following setting in menuconfig.

![Iotivity](./external/docs/media/iotivity.png)

> * External Functions > IOTIVITY Config Parameters > Enable "enable / disable iotivity stack"
> * Check "iotivity stack version" value to `1.3-rel`
> * Change "Default pthread stack size for the receive-handler thread" value to `32768`
> * Enable "enable iotivity security"

* Iotivity uses `scons`. You have to install `scons` to compile Iotivity.
```bash
$ sudo apt-get install scons
```

For more information on OCF certification, click [here](https://openconnectivity.org/certified-product/artiktm-053-smart-iot-module).

## How to enable SLIP

ARTIK05x supports SLIP (Serial Line IP) interface. To test your SLIP interface, you need to make the following menuconfig changes:

> * Device Drivers > Network Device/PHY Support > Enable "SLIP (serial line) support"
> * Networking Support > LwIP options > Enable "Support serial line IP interface"

The following is the default setting of the ARTIK05x IP to "10.0.0.2". The Linux PC as the host is set to "10.0.0.1" as an example.

```
TASH>>ifconfig
sl2     Link encap: 00:00:00:00:00:00   RUNNING: DOWN   MTU: 1500
        inet addr: 10.0.0.2     Mask: 255.255.255.0

wl1     Link encap: 00:00:00:00:00:00   RUNNING: DOWN   MTU: 1500
        inet addr: 0.0.0.0      Mask: 255.255.255.255

lo0     Link encap: 00:00:00:00:00:00   RUNNING: DOWN   MTU: 0
        inet addr: 127.0.0.1    Mask: 255.0.0.0
        inet6 addr: ::1
```

A new device named `sl2` has been set up as above. It is set to use `/dev/ttyS4` device (default: XUART3) as SLIP. Connect LinuxPC and ARTIK05x with SLIP.

In the Starter Kit, pins 8 and 10 of CON704 are XUART3.

```
      5 |_|_|  6
      7 |_|_|  8 XUART3_RXD
      9 |_|_| 10 XUART3_TXD
     11 |_|_| 12
```

On a Linux PC, you can start SLIP with the `slattach` command.

```bash
$ sudo slattach -p slip -s 115200 -d -L /dev/ttyUSB2
slattach: tty_open: looking for lock
slattach: tty_open: trying to open /dev/ttyUSB2
slattach: tty_open: /dev/ttyUSB2 (fd=3) slattach: tty_set_speed: 115200
slattach: tty_set_databits: 8
slattach: tty_set_stopbits: 1
slattach: tty_set_parity: N
slip started on /dev/ttyUSB2 interface sl0
```

```bash
$ sudo ifconfig sl0 10.0.0.1/24 up
$ ifconfig
sl0       Link encap:Serial Line IP
          inet addr:10.0.0.1  P-t-P:10.0.0.1  Mask:255.255.255.0
          UP POINTOPOINT RUNNING NOARP MULTICAST  MTU:296  Metric:1
          RX packets:75 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 frame:0
          TX packets:105 errors:0 dropped:0 overruns:0 carrier:0
          collisions:0 txqueuelen:10
          RX bytes:6060 (6.0 KB)  TX bytes:10052 (10.0 KB)
```

You will be able to test the SLIP interface with a simple `PING` test on Linux PC and ARTIK05x respectively.

```bash
$ ping 10.0.0.2
PING 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=255 time=15.8 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=255 time=15.5 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=3 ttl=255 time=15.5 ms
64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=4 ttl=255 time=15.5 ms

## Thumb Mode Build

"TizenRT for ARTIK" can build `THUMB` mode. This feature can reduce the binary size and improve performance. However, there is no guarantee that performance will increase as you expect for all features. If you want to know more about `THUMB` mode in contrast to `ARM` mode, check out the ARM documentation.

You can enable THUMB mode by setting it in menuconfig as follows.
> * Chip Selection > Enable "Thumb instruction set support"

## Crash Dump Analysis Tool

In your development with ARTIK05x, you may experience `CRASH`. You do not need to be embarrassed.
So we prepared you to do `RAMDUMP` and `DEBUGGING` in the following way.

To do RAMDUMP and DEBUGGING, you must first set it in menuconfig as follows.
> * Board Selection > Enable "Enable Board level logging of crash dumps"
> * Board Selection > ARTIK05X crash dump configuration > Enable All Items [Recommands]

#### Download dump file and paring

The following is a forced CRASH. (For Example)

## ADB(Artik Debug Bridge)

ADB(Android Debug Bridge) is a command-line utility included with Google’s Android SDK. ADB can control your device over USB from a computer, copy files back and forth, install and uninstall apps, run shell commands, and more. Our ADB(Artik Debug Bridge) is compatible to original ADB(Android Debug Bridge) to communicate with a device on TizenRT.Unlike android, our ADB is only accessed by network connection. (Unfortunately our ARTIK05x doesn't have USB interface)

#### How adb works

Our artik05x series is adb device, can connect adb server over WIFI or SLIP(Serial Line IP). Basically Android ADB is normally working with USB interface, can notice device is being connected or not. But connection over WIFI can't notice device is connected or alive, That's why we should connect device by enforce. For more specific says, after artik05x has been booted, adb device is waiting for connection. And next, Linux, Win or MAC's adb clients can connect device over WIFI.

![ADB01](./external/docs/media/adb01.png)

#### Build ADB

ADB is not enabled by default, you should enable feature. ADB server port is default port by android, if you change port, you should enter correct port number while connecting adb.

ADB shell stack size is related to executed command, if stack size is too short, it can be occurred stack overflow.

![ADB02](./external/docs/media/adb02.png)

#### Connect to a device over Wi-Fi

Adb usually communicates with the device over USB, but Artik05x can't support USB interface, so you should use adb over Wi-Fi or SLIP.

 1. Set the target device to listen for a TCP/IP connection on port 5555.
```
TASH>> adb
```

 2. Connect to the device by its IP address. (If ADB port is 5555, port number can be passed)
```
TASH>> adb connect device_ip_address
```

 3. Confirm that your host computer is connected to the target device:
```bash
$ adb devices
List of devices attached
device_ip_address:5555 device
```

You're now good to go!

If the adb connection is ever lost:

 1. Make sure that your host is still connected to the same Wi-Fi network your Android device is.
 2. Reconnect by executing the adb connect step again.
 3. Or if that doesn't work, reset your adb host:
```bash
$ adb kill-server
```
or
```bash
$ adb disconnect
```
or
```bash
$ adb disconnect device_ip_address
```

Then start over from the beginning.

#### Query for devices

Before issuing adb commands, it is helpful to know what device instances are connected to the adb server. You can generate a list of attached devices using the devices command.
```bash
$ adb devices -l
```

In response, adb prints this status information for each device:

* Serial number: A string created by adb to uniquely identify the device by its port number. Here's an example ip address: 10.0.0.2:5555
* State: The connection state of the device can be one of the following:
  * offline: The device is not connected to adb or is not responding.
  * device: The device is now connected to the adb server. Note that this state does not imply that the Android system is fully booted and operational because the device connects to adb while the system is still booting. However, after boot-up, this is the normal operational state of an device.
  * no device: There is no device connected.
* Description: If you include the -l option, the devices command tells you what the device is. This information is helpful when you have multiple devices connected so that you can tell them apart.
The following example shows the `devices -l` command and its output.
```bash
$ adb devices -l
List of devices attached
10.0.0.2:5555          device product:ARTIK model:ARTIK053 device:1.0.11
```

#### Copy files to/from a device

Use the pull and push commands to copy files to and from an device. The pull and push commands let you copy arbitrary directories and files to any location in a device.

To copy a file or directory and its sub-directories from the device, do the following:
```bash
$ adb pull remote local
```

To copy a file or directory and its sub-directories to the device, do the following:
```bash
$ adb push local remote
```
Replace local and remote with the paths to the target files/directory on your development machine (local) and on the device (remote). For example:
```bash
# Host(foo.txt) → TizenRT(/mnt/foo.txt)
$ ls -al foo.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 bt.cho bt.cho 26199  Mar 8 19:28 foo.txt

$ adb push foo.txt /mnt/foo.txt
9 KB/s (26199 bytes in 2.747s)

$ adb shell ls -l /mnt
/mnt:
 -rw-rw-rw-   26199 foo.txt

# TizenRT(/mnt/foo.txt) → Host(bar.txt)
$ adb pull /mnt/foo.txt bar.txt
200 KB/s (26199 bytes in 0.127s)

# Check file
$ diff foo.txt bar.txt
```

#### Issue shell commands

You can use the shell command to issue device commands through adb, with or without entering the adb remote shell on the device. To issue a single command without entering a remote shell, use the shell command like this:
```bash
# adb shell shell_command
$ adb shell ls
/:
 dev/
 mnt/
 proc/
 var/
$ adb shell cd mnt
$ adb shell ls
/mnt:
```

Or enter a remote shell on a device like this:
```bash
$ adb shell
TASH>> ls
/:
 dev/
 mnt/
 proc/
 var/
TASH>> cd proc
TASH>> ls
/proc:
 0/
 1/
 2/
 3/
 4/
 6/
 8/
 9/
 10/
 11/
 12/
 fs/
 mtd
 partitions
 uptime
 version
TASH>> cat version
 Board: ARTIK053
 Version: 1.0.11
 Commit Hash: 928ba17fd2f117bc3de307f43e608942a0dc41b8
 Build User: root@testbed
 Build Time: 2018-03-14 19:34:37
TASH>> exit
```
When you are ready to exit the remote shell, press Control + D or type exit.

#### Stop the adb server

In some cases, you might need to terminate the adb server process and then restart it to resolve the problem (e.g., if adb does not respond to a command).

To stop the adb server, use the adb kill-server command. You can then restart the server by issuing any other adb command.
```bash
$ adb kill-server
```

## J-Link

SEGGER [J-Links](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/) are the most widely used line of debug probes available today. They've proven their worth for more than 10 years. This popularity stems from the unparalleled performance, extensive feature set, large number of supported CPUs, and compatibility with all popular development environments.

#### Download Ozone & SystemView Software

 * J-Link Software and Documentation Pack [J-link](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack)
 * The J-Link Debugger [Ozone](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#Ozone)
 * Real-time Analysis and Visualization [SystemView](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#SystemView)

#### How to use Ozone

![JLink00](./external/docs/media/jlink00.png)

First, connect J-Link and ARTIK05X. To connect, a debug cable is required. The required cables are as follows.

![JLink01](./external/docs/media/jlink01.png)

 * JTAG (2x10 2.54mm) to SWD (2x5 1.27mm) Cable Adapter Board
 * 10-pin 2x5 Socket-Socket 1.27mm IDC (SWD) Cable

Then, run the Ozone program that you installed. Connect in the following order.
> * File > New > New Project Wizard
> * Target Device > Device > Select "ARTIK05X"

![JLink02](./external/docs/media/jlink02.png)

And attach it to the target module. If it is properly attached, you can check the console log.

![JLink03](./external/docs/media/jlink03.png)

Sometimes Ozone does not find few file paths correctly. In the ozone program, press f1 to view the user manual pdf file. Refer to Section 6.4 for more precise routing.

We can debug using the Ozone, but can not fusing new TizenRT Binary. If you want to fuse binaries, please use an IDE or type “make download $(partition)” in Linux shell.

#### How to use SystemView

First, copy the support file so that SystemView can recognize TizenRT.
 * From TizenRT: $(TOPDIR)/external/sysview/SYSVIEW_TizenRT.txt
 * To SystemView: C:\Program Files (x86)\SEGGER\SystemView_V252a\Description

![SysView01](./external/docs/media/sysview01.png)

You enable SystemView in menuconfig in the following order:
> * External Functions > Select "SystemView"
> * Chip Selection > S5J Peripheral Support > Enable "TIMER2"

You can choose your preferences in SystemView.

![SysView02](./external/docs/media/sysview02.png)

ARTIK05x now supports Single-Shot Recording only. SEGGER will support Continuous Recording in April 2018.

![SysView03](./external/docs/media/sysview03.png)
![SysView04](./external/docs/media/sysview04.png)
![SysView05](./external/docs/media/sysview05.png)

Enter the RTT address value to be output at boot time.

If the connection is successful, you can check it using the SystemView tool as follows.

## Factory Reset

If you can not boot normally, you can change os to the initial version. This is possible if there is an initialization binary in memory.

#### How to Download the Initialization Binaries

You compress the compiled firmware and download it to the board.

```bash
$ cd os
$ make image factory
```
```bash
$ cd os
$ make download factory
```

#### How to enter initialization mode

When you press the RESET button (SW700) to reboot the Starter Kit, press and hold the `ARDUINO RESET` button (SW701) for 10 seconds. Enter initialization mode as follows.

#### Factory Reset Log
```
.....
Factory reset.
Erasing boot partitions...
....................................e
Erased 600 sectors
Flashing factory image...
Uncompressed size: 1258496 = 0x133400
resetting ...
.....
```

## OTA

You can use the OTA feature when updating the OS binaries externally.

#### How to create an OTA binary

Compress the compiled firmware and add the CRC information for the OTA.

```bash
$ cd os
$ make image ota
```

#### How to fusing OTA binary

##### using `UART`

```bash
$ cd os
$ make download ota
```

##### using `YMODEM` (in U-BOOT using Minicom)

```
U-BOOT > erase 0x044A0000 +0x15E000               # erase ota area
Erased 350 sectors
U-BOOT > loady 0x044A0000                         # load ymodem

##### using `HTTP` (own webserver)

You need the following settings in menuconfig.
> * Application Configuration > Examples > OTA downloader

```
TASH>> ota http://192.168.1.10/ota.bin /dev/mtdblock7
TASH>> reboot
```

#### using `ARTIK CLOUD`

1) Prepare a device type in ARTIK Cloud

Log into ARTIK Cloud and go to the developer portal. Under the **Device Types section**, create a new device type (or reuse an existing one) that will be used for testing Device Management and OTA from a device manufacturer's point of view. Make sure the device type has properties enabled by clicking the **Device Management** tab of the device type.

![ARTIKCLOUD_OTA](./external/docs/media/ota_artikcloud01.png)

2) Configure the board

In order for the services running on the A05x to be properly configured to connect to ARTIK Cloud, a few parameters need to be changed. This needs to be done only once as parameters will be stored and reused across reboots. Type the commands below to specify the ARTIK Cloud Device Type ID that you chose for the device (the one that has properties enabled), then configure the address of a NTP server that operates well in your region.
```
TASH>> onboard dtid <device type ID>
TASH>> onboard ntp <NTP server address>
TASH>> onboard config
```

3) Onboard the board to ARTIK Cloud

Use a mobile application (available on iOS and Android) to onboard the device to ARTIK Cloud, scan its QR code then follow the instructions until the device is properly created in ARTIK Cloud. After onboarding, the board should successfully connect to ARTIK Cloud.

4) Upload the package to ARTIK Cloud

In ARTIK Cloud's developer portal, go to the Device Management tab of the relevant device type, then click the **OTA Updates** subtab, then click the **Upload new image** button.

![ARTIKCLOUD_OTA](./external/docs/media/ota_artikcloud02.png)

5) Trigger the update

Go to ARTIK Cloud's developer portal, and browse to the device type's **Device Management** pane. In the devices list, identify the currently connected board by its device ID.

Check the device (or devices) you want to update, click **Execute** then **OTA update**.

![ARTIKCLOUD_OTA](./external/docs/media/ota_artikcloud03.png)

In the next window, you can select a date to schedule the update, or leave empty to launch the update right now. Click **Perform OTA Update** when ready.

## U-Boot for ARTIK05x

* You can refer to the following [link](https://github.com/SamsungARTIK/u-boot-artik/blob/artik-05x/README.md).
```bash
git clone --depth=50 --branch=artik-05x https://github.com/SamsungARTIK/u-boot-artik.git
```

## Configure USB Drivers

Install and configure USB drivers, so OpenOCD is able to communicate with JTAG interface on ARTIK05x board as well as with UART interface used to upload application for flash. Follow steps below specific to your operating system.

#### Windows

![Zadig](./external/docs/media/zadig.png)

 * Using standard micro USB B cable connect ARTIK05x Starter Kit to the computer.
 * Wait until ARTIK05x Board is recognized by Windows and drives are installed. If it do not install automatically, then then download Zadig tool (Zadig_X.X.exe) from http://zadig.akeo.ie/ and run it.
 * In Zadig tool go to "Options" and check "List All Devices".
 * Check the list of devices that should contain two ARTIK05x specific USB entries: "Dual RS232-HS (Interface 0)" and "Dual RS232-HS (Interface 1)". The driver name would be "FTDIBUS (vxxxx)" and USB ID: 0403 6010.

#### Linux

 * Using standard micro USB B cable connect ARTIK05x Starter Kit to the computer.
 * Open a terminal, enter `ls -l /dev/ttyUSB*` command and check, if board's USB ports are recognized by the OS. You are looking for similar result:

```bash
$ ls -l /dev/ttyUSB*
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 188, 0 Oct 25 13:42 /dev/ttyUSB0
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 188, 1 Oct 25 13:42 /dev/ttyUSB1
```

 * The `/dev/ttyUSBn` interface with lower number is used for JTAG communication. The other interface is routed to ARTIK05x's serial port (UART) used for upload of application to ARTIK05x's flash.
